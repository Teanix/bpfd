## 说明
目前已经弃用，社区正在研究在Android设备上采用bpftrace的方法，但是可以借鉴该项目的内容

## BPFd (Berkeley Packet Filter Daemon) - Deprecated, see below.

Deprecation Warning:
If you're looking for running BCC on Android devices, please look at [BCC using
Androdeb](https://github.com/joelagnel/androdeb/blob/master/BCC.md) instead.
BPFd is not undergoing active development at the moment, and Android has
switched to using androdeb for running BCC. However BPFd is still available in
this repository and if you want to use BPFd with BCC, please look at this [pull
request](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/pull/1675) to get needed BCC support.
Also please see the discussion [on this thread](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/pull/2298)
for reasons for deprecation, etc. Also note that, future development
of eBPF tracing tools on Android is focusing on running bpftrace on Android as that
is where the community is moving towards. I will keep everyone updated about the
developments, if you are interested in this area, let me know if you want me to
add you to my email notification list (Also share your company name and project).

If you still want to work on BPFd, you are most likely on your own. See below for BPFd design.

BPFd faciliates easier loading of eBPF programs using simple stdio interface.

One of the main usescases of this work is easier running of BCC tools across
system and architecture boundaries for cross-development.

Before this project's birth, the BCC tools architecture was as follows: ![BCC
architecture](images/bcc-arch.png) 

BPFd based invocations partition this, thus making it possible to do
cross-development and execution of the tools across machine and architecture
boundaries. For instance, kernel sources that the BCC tools depend on can be on
a development machine, with eBPF code being loaded onto a remote machine. This
paritioning is illustrated in the following diagram ![BCC architecture with
BPFd](images/bcc-with-bpfd-arch.png) 

An article is in the works to explain the history and design more. Meanwhile
look at `INSTALL.md` for easy to install package downloads, or
slightly-more-compilicated build yourself instructions.

This project is very early, please help by submitting patches or documentation.
